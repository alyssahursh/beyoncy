# Beyoncy 
An e-commerce platform for Beyonc√© to sell her wares. Ruby on Rails web application built by a four-person team. Go shopping [here](http://beyoncy.herokuapp.com/). (Beyoncy is deployed on Heroku, so you may need to give the page a minute to wake up the server the first time you load it.)

## What is this project about?
* This project was the final Rails project for the classroom portion of Ada Developers Academy.
* The assignment involved building an e-commerce website with inventory and order tracking, and a custom-built shopping cart.
* We were assigned a team of four people. Together, we used agile best practices to write user stories, hold daily stand-ups, monitor our velocity, avoid scope-creep, and ensure on-time delivery to our client.

## If we had more time
* We'd make better use of Foundation to make the site mobile-responsive
* We would fix the known bugs related to not-logged-in users hitting unhandled errors when they attempt to access pages they shouldn't have access to.
* We would add a workflow to allow not-logged-in users to check out.
